## üåü Project Summary and Purpose

This application is designed to bridge the gap between students and professional networking by creating an accessible platform tailored to university-level students. Its primary goal is to:

- **Facilitate Connections**: Allow students to connect with their peers to build a professional network.
- **Mentorship Support**: Enable students to match with experienced mentors for career guidance.

Many students face barriers in developing meaningful professional relationships due to limited opportunities, focus on academic achievements, and lack of career guidance. This platform addresses these challenges by combining networking tools with mentorship capabilities.

To make networking more accessible and solve these challenges, the application will include the following features:
- **Onboarding Quiz [In Progress]**: Helps users set up personalized profiles.
- **User Connections [In Progress]**: Search and follow other users.
- **Message Board [In Progress]**: Post and discuss career-related questions, with an option for anonymous posts.
- **Mentorship Matching [In Progress]**: Pair students with mentors using a relevancy-based matching system.
- **AI Resume Feedback [Optional]**: Provide actionable suggestions for resume improvements.
- **Gamification [In Progress]**: Achievements and badges, e.g., ‚ÄúReached first 50 connections!‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnswered 10 questions!‚Äù.
- **Separate Mentorship Platform [In Progress]**: A dedicated space for mentor-mentee interactions.
